# clipboard history with text+image support: fzf+ueberzugpp wrapper, xclip.

# this is beyond impractical and has many bugs.
# it's an exercise in whether this was
# possible to achieve with the given tools.

# text clips are created as empty files
# with the clip as the FILENAME 
# (yes, I know: see next paragraph)
# thus, there are placeholders swapped in 
# for characters like ":" in text clips.

# in theory, saving text clips IN files
# would be possible with:
# - search through files (ie. fzf+ripgrep)
# - non-image previews integrated to fzfub

# st is hardcoded but could be swapped
# just update parameters accordingly
# my version of fzfub is in this repo
# with bindings for copy, delete, etc.

# this doubles as a select-to-clipboard menu
# for any folder given, which can then be
# bound as a shortcut: `cliphist sel ~/folder`

# bind `cliphist add` and `cliphist sel` to shortcuts
# to copy text, press your shortcut key for add,
# to copy images, first copy normally, then run your shortcut key
# if you're using dwm or similar, you may need to ensure that the
# window class `fzfmenu` or title `fzf` has floating property
